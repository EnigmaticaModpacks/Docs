# Allocating Memory

The method to allocate memory depends on the program that you are using to run the modpack. Instructions for the most popular launchers can be found below.

The amount of memory that should be allocated for Enigmatica modpacks is shown in the table below, but optimal amounts may vary depending on the total memory available in your system&#x20;

| Modpack                       | Minimum | Recommended | Recommended (HD)\* |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| Enigmatica                    | 5 GB    | 6 GB        | 8 GB               |
| Enigmatica 2                  | 7 GB    | 7 GB        | 8 GB               |
| Enigmatica 2: Light           | 4 GB    | 5 GB        | 7 GB               |

| Enigmatica 5                  | 5 GB    | 6 GB        | 8 GB               |
| Enigmatica 6                  | 5 GB    | 6 GB        | 8 GB               |
| Enigmatica 8                  | 5 GB    | 6 GB        | 8 GB               |
| Enigmatica 9                  | 5 GB    | 6 GB        | 8 GB               |

## Maximum Allocation

Never allocate more memory than your PC can spare. The below table shows maximum values depending on how much RAM your PC has.

| Total System RAM (GB) | Max RAM Allocation | Max RAM Allocation (HD)\* |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| 4 GB                  | 3 GB               | 3 GB                      |
| 8 GB                  | 6.5 GB             | 6.5 GB                    |
| 12 GB                 | 8 GB               | 10 GB                     |
| 16 GB                 | 8 GB               | 10 GB                     |

Assigning more than shown here is never recommend, as you may actually get worse performance. If you're using shaders or a HD resource pack, the maximum is 10 GB.
